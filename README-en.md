Warning:
----------
Since a few days, Viessmann as set a protection on their server to avoid unofficial third-party tools to use their api. It's more than likely that the code here won't work for most of you. I won't do any modification to avoid this since it's their right to control the access to their service.
This api as always been a personal project I have shared but has nevre received any official consent/support from Viessman.


Here is the official communication you'll receive

>Thatâ€™s

>We

Implementation of an API to get data that are expose through the viessmann service.
This service is available through oauth2 autorization and use HATEOAS approach. 
Viessmann is using the specification siren such as defined here:
https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren

The goal of this api is to hide technical aspect to expose only raw data so that users doesn't have to know anything about OAuth2 and Siren. 

This api is implemented in php and is package as a phar(php archive). This phar is available in the release part.
